To get acquainted to github.
I'm a physicist originally. I went through many branches during my professional life.
The main thread was magnetic resonance, which make me do a lot of programming.
Now I'm old and I wonder I should not have stick to something more deep, like
the foundation of logic, something like "what is reasoning" or maybe poetry?
